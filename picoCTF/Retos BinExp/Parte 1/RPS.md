## Objetivo
Here's a program that plays rock, paper, scissors against you. I hear something good happens if you win 5 times in a row. The program's source code with the flag redacted can be downloaded [here](https://artifacts.picoctf.net/c/146/game-redacted.c). Connect to the program with netcat: `$ nc saturn.picoctf.net 56279`
